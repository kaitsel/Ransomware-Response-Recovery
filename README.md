# Ransomware: Lifecycle and Forensic Timeline

## Project Overview

This project will provide a comprehensive forensic timeline and analysis of a ransomware attack execution. It will demonstrate the complete lifecycle of an attack, covering each stage with thorough details of what occurs and providing examples of how it can be performed using a virtual machine for demonstration. It is important to illustrate and understand this process today due to the ever-increasing ransomware attacks faced by major corporations in the United Kingdom, such as Co-Op and M&S, which have had a significant impact on their businessâ€™s reputation and compliance with frameworks such as NIST, ISO, SANS, and the GDPR. The expected outcome will include four repositories, which will showcase the attack phases and the recommendations on how to mitigate the risk of this attack occurring again.
