# Ransomware: Lifecycle and Forensic Timeline

## Project Overview

This project will provide a comprehensive forensic timeline and analysis of a ransomware attack execution. It will demonstrate the complete lifecycle of an attack, covering each stage with thorough details of what occurs and providing examples of how it can be performed using a virtual machine for demonstration. It is important to illustrate and understand this process today due to the ever-increasing ransomware attacks faced by major corporations in the United Kingdom, such as Co-Op and M&S, which have had a significant impact on their business’s reputation and compliance with frameworks such as NIST, ISO, SANS, and the GDPR. The expected outcome will include four repositories, which will showcase the attack phases and the recommendations on how to mitigate the risk of this attack occurring again. 

## Case Study: NHS Ransomware Attack

- Attack Type: Ransomware through Phishing

## Disclaimer

All malicious code is either illustrative or temporary due to ethical and legal issues. Due to this device being used for other means besides running the virtual machine, fully developed ransomware code was not used to ensure the safety of the software. All code will be within the bounds of the virtual machine and will not affect the computer that is hosting. The system will be connected to the Internet through an Ethernet cable; however, the device will have no access to a wider network, ensuring any issues that may arise are contained and can be mitigated locally. All recommendations within this project should not be used for malicious purposes and have been done for educational use to explore what causes certain flags within a system and what and how things can be broken to gain malicious access.
