# Ransomware Response and Recovery - Forensic Timeline

**BFOR 419 Class Project - Digital Forensics Investigation**

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive forensic timeline and analysis of a ransomware attack execution, created for educational purposes as part of the BFOR 419 (Digital Forensics) coursework. The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a sophisticated ransomware attack from initial reconnaissance through recovery.

## Case Study: TechCorp Industries Ransomware Attack

- **Attack Type:** Conti Ransomware Variant
- **Timeline:** March 1-15, 2024 (14-day attack progression)
- **Scope:** 150+ compromised systems, 2.3TB data exfiltration
- **Industry:** Corporate Technology Company

## Repository Contents

### üìã Main Timeline Document
- **[forensic_timeline.md](forensic_timeline.md)** - Complete chronological timeline of the ransomware attack with detailed timestamps, activities, and evidence artifacts

### üìä Detailed Analysis
- **[attack_phases.md](attack_phases.md)** - In-depth analysis of each attack phase mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- **[evidence_artifacts.md](evidence_artifacts.md)** - Comprehensive catalog of forensic artifacts and evidence collection procedures
- **[recovery_procedures.md](recovery_procedures.md)** - Incident response and recovery procedures following industry best practices

### üìà Structured Data
- **[timeline_data.json](timeline_data.json)** - Machine-readable timeline data for visualization and analysis tools

## Attack Timeline Summary

1. **Days -14 to -10:** Reconnaissance and Initial Access (spear-phishing)
2. **Days -10 to -7:** Persistence and Privilege Escalation
3. **Days -7 to -3:** Discovery and Lateral Movement
4. **Days -3 to -1:** Data Exfiltration Preparation
5. **Day 0:** Ransomware Deployment and Impact

## Key Learning Objectives
